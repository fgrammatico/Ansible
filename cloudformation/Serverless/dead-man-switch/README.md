Dead Man Switch
===============
This Lambda will check periodically cloudtrail if your user has logged into AWS console in the last 90 days (N=90 days). 
In case of missed login the script will loop into a bucket in S3 (DMSBUCKET) for files containing the email body of your dead man switch recipients.
The files must be created as follow:

* For each file a single email recipient
